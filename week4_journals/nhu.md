## Challenges
* Since we want separate applications, we find a hard time importing and using classes of one project in another. For example, the OnlineStore needs access to manage StarbucksCard but we do not want to have repeated code.  
## Solutions
* Restructuring the architecture so that common classes are accessible by all the apps.

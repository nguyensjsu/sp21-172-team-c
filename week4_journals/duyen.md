## Challenges

- I reused Lab 7 and modified it steps by step. The Cybersource API has used resource = "/pts/v2/payments". When I tried to remove the email attribute since the Starbuck payment method does not require it, the App failed to run the "gradle bootRun" command. It is one of the challenges, and I need to learn how to modify the Cybersource API in specific. 
- I am learning to implement both vertical and horizontal Navigation Bar to connect the Starbuck Card template and Add Payment Method template.
- Deploy Online Store App on GKE.

## Discussion: 

- During week 1, the team started analyzing term project together. 
- My tasks for week 1: 
- [x] Add payment method - Initial Billing Html (Front-end)
- [x] Add payment method - Initial Credit Html (Front-end)
- [ ] Create Online Store App
- In the following weeks, I will be responsible for the Online Store App.

## Link to Week 1 Commit:

*Initial Payment Html*

* https://github.com/nguyensjsu/sp21-172-team-c/commit/433568e5566cba35e1941a590da1338fb95a7cd1

## Challenges

- I have a bit more experience working with Front-end compared to Back-end. So connecting the two is one of the challenges.
- Specifically, for week 1, removing the unused elements from the Starbuck Payment HTML source is a challenge because I need to decide what to use and not use for the project.

# Week 2 Individual Journal - Nhu Nguyen
## Tasks
* Adding functions into RestAPI that allow admins to use backoffice app to read and insert/delete data of a customer
* Connect backoffice app to the same database as the online store to retrieve customer info
## Accomplishments
* Initializing database
* Review RestAPI
## Challenges
* At first, tasks were unclear when looking at cybersource portion in the instruction that belongs with the backoffice app
* RestAPI needs to be added with rewards managing functions, this is currently still a work in progress
## Solutions
* Team discussed and concluded that backoffice and online store do not make transactions, therefore do not need cybersource, for it is a payment support.

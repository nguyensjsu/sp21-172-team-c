## Link to Week 2 Commit:

*Create Online Store App with Minor Updates*

* https://github.com/nguyensjsu/sp21-172-team-c/commit/f7b615eb79e01e40dbd9d194a68b598f21bdbc22

## Challenges

- The biggest challenge right now is to write an Online Store App that uses the Cybersource API. Changing design, changing input fields will also make the Spring project does not run.
- Therefore, I plan to use the tools available from Lab 7 and Lab 7 itself as a reference to start. I plan to change each detail from there and develop it to look like the actual website if there is time. Doing that can ensure the code is still running and immediately know what changes will cause the code not running and so I can focus on understanding and solving the problem.
